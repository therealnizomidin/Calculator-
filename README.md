# Basic Calculator in C

This is a simple command-line calculator written in C. It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The program uses a `switch-case` control structure to handle the operations and allows repeated calculations using a loop.

## Features

- User-friendly text-based menu
- Accepts two numbers and an operator
- Displays the result after each operation
- Handles division by zero safely
- Option to continue or exit

##  How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter two numbers
2. Asks the user to choose an operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
3. Performs the selected operation
4. Shows the result
5. Asks if the user wants to perform another calculation
